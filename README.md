# tinycarecode ğŸ¤—ğŸ’–
A VS Code extension that displays self-care reminders from [@tinycarebot](https://twitter.com/tinycarebot), inspired by [tiny-care-terminal](https://github.com/notwaldorf/tiny-care-terminal)!

## How to use:
1. Install the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thefifthisa.tinycarecode).
2. Go [here](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) to create a new Twitter app and get your API keys.
3. Go to your settings (`File` > `Preferences` > `Settings`), find the `tinycarecode` drop-down menu, and input the keys.
    * You may also change `refresh_after` (the number of minutes until a new reminder shows up) here.
4. Refresh the window. If everything is working fine, your status bar should now have a `ğŸ¤—ğŸ’–: please take care` message!
